# PowerUps

## About

This mod allows spawning of items that give special powers / bad things, fully customizable. Players can get only one 
PowerUp item at time. If they collect a new one, the previous one is replaced and disabled.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This module is complex to set up, so take time to carefully read this documentation and to test your configuration.

## Installation

Installation of this module can be done in a normal way. You'll find installation process in [modules page](../modules.md#installing-modules) of the doc.

## Setup instructions

#### 1. Define where items will spawn

By default, items will randomly spawn within your BATTLE region. If it's ok for you, go next step, otherwise type 
`/pa <arena> !pu dropspawn`. Then create PowerUps spawn locations using `/pa <arena> spawn set powerupX` (with X as a number).

#### 2. Choose how item spawning is triggered

You can choose to spawn PowerUp items with a time frequency or when a number of death is reached in your arena.
Run `/pa <arena> !pu time <number>` to use time frequency, run `/pa <arena> !pu deaths <number>` otherwise.

#### 3. Create your own list of special items!

Edit your arena config file (located in the folder: `plugins/pvparena/arenas`).
Now create a `items` entry under `module.powerups`. Then add your effects using [documentation below](#powerups-items) 
or just copying the preset list [at the end of this page](#example-of-items-configuration).


## Config settings

These settings are under **module.powerups** node in arena config file.

- **usage.trigger**: what is counted to make items spawn. Possible values are `TIME` (default) and `DEATHS`
- **usage.frequency**: each time this value is reached, a powerup item will spawn (default: 0 - i.e. disabled). Should 
be a number of deaths or a number of seconds.
- **dropspawn**: If false, powerups spawn randomly in the BATTLE region. If true, powerups only spawn on dedicated spawn 
points. (default: false)

> üö© **Tip:** 
> To create a spawn point for PowerUps in your arena, use `/pa <arena> spawn set powerupX` (where X is an integer)

## Commands

- `/pa <arena> !pu dropspawn` \- toggle dropspawn setting
- `/pa <arena> !pu time <number>` \- use time trigger for spawning and define spawn frequency (in seconds)
- `/pa <arena> !pu deaths <number>` \- use deaths trigger for spawning and define death frequency between item spawns

NB: ratio means a number between 0 and 1 used like a percentage. E.g. use 0.5 for 50% or 2.0 to double a value.

### Config settings

Sorry, but you'll need to create a freaking block of settings in your arena config file (c.f. example below).
To create it from zero, create keys under `module.powerups.items` which are the names of your PowerUp items.

Now, for each PowerUp **item**, you can add one or multiple **effects** (see above for effects definition).

Each **effect** has settings you can change, there are:
- **chance**: probability effect may be triggered. Should be a ratio between 0 and 1. (default: 1)
- **duration**: effect duration (c.f. table above for details). -1 means permanent. (default: -1)
- **factor**: c.f. table above for details. (default: 1)
- **diff**: c.f. table above for details. (default: 0)
- **potionEffect**: type of potion effect. A list of available effects can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html) \[only for potion_effect effect\]
- **items**: kind of item to repair. Can be `HELMET`, `CHESTPLATE`, `LEGGINGS`, `BOOTS` or any item type (like `SWORD`) 
\[only for repair effect\]
- **mobType**: type of mob to spawn. A list of available mob types can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html) \[only for spawn_mob effect\]

Now your PowerUp item has one or several effects, you can add it attributes:
- **item**: type of item. A list of available item names can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html). (Required)
- **lore**: item lore as a list of strings (default: empty)
- **uses**: number of times the PowerUp can be used, use `-1` for no limit (default: -1)
- **lifetime**: time (in seconds) during the item can be used, use `-1` for no limit (default: -1)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **About uses and lifetime:**
> These settings make possible to limit Powerup usage. When the limit is reached, PowerUp item is automatically 
> destroyed. If both settings are active, this will happen when the first of the two limits is reached.
> 
> Effects enabled on **pickup are not affected** by these settings because they are only triggered once.
