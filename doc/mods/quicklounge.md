# QuickLounge

## About

This mod is like the standard lounge but starts the game automatically.

## Installation

This module is bundled with PVPArena and doesn't need to be installed.

## Setup

Just configure [autoclass](../faq.md#is-it-possible-to-automatically-affect-a-class-to-all-players-or-to-a-specific-team) 
for your arena. When minimum players join the game (`ready.minPlayers` setting), the countdown is triggered. Players can still
join the arena during this time. Once countdown is out, the game begins.

Countdown duration can be changed editing `time.startCountDown` setting.
