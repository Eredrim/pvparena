## Commands

> **ðŸš© Tips:**  
> - If you add new chests to your map, don't forget to register them with `/pa [arena] !br clearinv`.
> - BlockRestore is designed for block destruction, chest and block usage only. If you need advanced restoring 
>   (especially entities), please prefer [WorldEdit](./worldedit.md) mod.

> âš™ **Technical precisions:**  
> - BlockRestore is fully asynchronous and may take some time restore the battlefield (few seconds in most cases). 
    This one is not reachable during the process.
> - Chest restoring lags badly for the first time, because it searches the BATTLE region(s) for chests and saves location 
>   of each of them.
> - Due to API limitations on servers that are **not based on PaperMC**, destruction of linked blocks (like wall torches
>   when the support block is broken) is limited to doors and non solid blocks on the top of the support block, along 
>   with directional blocks on the other faces.
