# Flags

> â„¹ This goal is designed to be played in teams

## Description

There is a flag per team. Team A captures the flag of team B and brings it home. 
To do this, simply hit/click on flags.

## Setup

You can use any solid block as flag. Flags automatically take team color if block type is one
of the following material (color prefix doesn't matter):

* WHITE_BANNER
* WHITE_CARPET
* WHITE_CONCRETE
* WHITE_CONCRETE_POWDER 
* WHITE_GLAZED_TERRACOTTA 	
* WHITE_SHULKER_BOX
* WHITE_STAINED_GLASS 
* WHITE_STAINED_GLASS_PANE
* WHITE_TERRACOTTA
* WHITE_WALL_BANNER

<br>

To set a flag, use `/pa <arenaname> flag set <teamname>`. It enables block selection.
Just left-click on your flag block. All flag blocks must have same type.

> ðŸš© **One more thing:**  
You can activate a special "touchdown" way of playing. Set a flag called "touchdown", it will be BLACK ingame. 
Players claim this flag and bring it home. Only one team can bring this flag home, obviously :)
